    "**1. Random Forest : -**\n",
    "Decision Trees are known for many uses like for drug analysis using tree based classifciation. Decision Trees are known to overfit and generally have problem dealing with noises. \n",
    "This is where Random Forest is used where random number of trees are generated with random number of features and then the final tree is produced by combining the previous trees which were weighted based on their accuracy. This usually boosts the performance wherever Decision Trees are used. Random forest can also do bad if our individual trees are compex. One more problem will be the time complexity , since we need to train individual trees and then average the result based on weights. However after the training phase is over it won't be requiring more time again. This model will work good because here we don't have a small data , and this is a classification problem with quite a number of features which will provide nice Information Gain. And as for overfitting Randomization with weighted trees will be dealing with it mostly.\n",
    "Refrence : - http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Support Vector Machines : -** \n",
    "Support Vector Machines. One of the most frequent uses of SVM is in text/handwriting recognition, since the underlying conept can be difficult. The strengths of such model is it can capture the underlying concept very well since we can change kernels from linear( Similar to Logistic Regression ) to RBF , specify the maxmimum degree of the polynomial function , which finally returns the best possible function. So capturing difficult concepts is possible. The data available has many features so there might be a possibility of a difficult concept. The weakness of this model is that it takes a LOT of time to train. If a lot of data is available this is one of the worst approaches in terms of time/space complexity. So it is usually avoided if a large amount of data is available. You can split the training and testing data to minimize the training data but there is a slight chance that it might then capture the wrong concept , and would actually be a bad model. Here only 300 samples are there so it's quite easy to use SVM and capture easy/hard concept.\n",
    "Reference : - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Weighted K-N-N : -**\n",
    "KNN is a quite popular algorithm since , it usually is the case that a data point lying near to a specific with points with a particular label , will be of that label. Of course there might be noise in that data , but weighted K-N-N will be of help over there. Some practical uses are : Price of land/housing in a region can be predicted if it's near a rich locality etc; predicting if a region is prone to certain disasters , and many more. The strengths of this model is that it is robust to noise since the distance function that we need to define can be adjusted accordingly. Moreover the training time is very short. As for weaknesses the computational cost is high due to the fact that we need to calculate distance of a point from its k nearest neightbours. Moreover it's sometimes hard to identify the best value of K for the model. The space complexity is high too , since we need to store the weights, distance and all the data until we finish predicting. For the given problem I believe that this model would do suitably well , since it's often the case that if a person is in close proximity with a certain set of persons exhibiting common features then he is often labelled in the same way. Generally speaking if a person is in a group of failures he has a high chance of failing too.

    "Deciding the constraints of the problem as follows :-\n",
    "- Available Data will be minimum 100 samples and maximum can be anything. So for the minimum data SVM has the best F1 score among the three chosen models. Random Forest will get better if some parameters like depth of tree etc are tuned.\n",
    "- Limited resources & Cost : Of course the cost will be higher because we can see as amount of data increases the training time increases quite largely. This would require a higher load on machine performing the analysis. This would further increase the cost. The most time/space efficient model is K-N-N as the training time is quite_low and prediction time is also not that high.\n",
    "- Performance : SVM is the best model in terms of performance which is quite evident from the F1 score. SVM is quite good at capturing concepts with a good number of features or those which are complex and it gets better as amount of data increases. I think Random Forest will perform better than now if amount of data is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judging by the above characteristics SVM is the best model if cost is not an issue, moreover at some point in time , the population of student is going to increase which will force people to invest in the cost area of the machine to further balance the increase in population of students, and improve the model by training on more points. So considering all the aspects above and the future , I think investing now in a SVM based model will be the best thing since , it provides quite accurate result in not a large prediction time. The training time is a one time process and we will be more concerned about the testing_time. There is a large probability that the F1 score will subsequently increase with the population of students. The F1 score is necessary here becaue if the University decides to invest some special program for failing students to help them , can help since , if a model has high F1 score would correctly predict the students. This would allow to not invest wrongly in the falsely predicte students ."

    "**Answer: ** SVM is model that has an accuracy of predicting 85% correctly , which is quite good. SVM is used in situtations where data might not be linearly seperable , which might be the case here. A student's success or failure rate can depend on many factors and features. So there might be many situations where there is a complex relationship with the required variable value and the student's characteristics. To capture such an underlying concept a model with SVM is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves splitting two type of studens - successful ones and the non successful ones. The model just divides the two types of students either by lines etc. Sometimes the problem is not so easily solved by a line. In such cases our SVM can handle the problem efficiently. Our problem has 30 features which is quite a lot and the way they depend on each other and the success/failure rate is quite difficult to capture. SVM can then one by one first divide based on 1 feature then the second and further proceeding on the last 30 features. The common solution is our answer. One more important thing is that SVM has a way of measuring how similar our current student is similar to the students already categorized. It then uses this similarity as a measure and places students in one of the two categories depending one how similar is that particular student to the two types of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training from the above mentioned method it then just checks the relative position of the new testing point and just checks on which side of plane it lies. Since I am quite sure there will be difference between a successful student and a failing student so I don't need to worry about the two types of students being close to each other in terms of characteristics. There might be some exceptions , of course , for such cases SVM while training makes sure to maximize the distance between the two categories as much as possible.Even for exceptions there is a divider too which it tries to maximize its distance from the other two categories. As it might be evident training the model required a lot of time because capturing each of the features and making solutions to find the best one between the two set of labels will be time inefficient. It might be a cost to pay with such a high accuracy. However this time is only a one time burden , because it doesn't find the solutions again and again , just tests the new point on the best solution it found during the training time. As the number of data points increases , the time it takes to train also increase and so does the accuracy."
