# Facial Keypoint Detection

Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection<br>
Task: to detect the facial keypoints such as nose_tip , eye_center etc given images with around 15 labelled keypoints as data.<br>
Applied CNN using librarires Lasagne & Theano and achieved 56th position on the leaderboard.<br>

I do suggest to read the Report to get an In-depth look into my implementation, ideas and the project.
