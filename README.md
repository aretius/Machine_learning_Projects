# Machine_learning_Projects
These are my Machine learning projects starting from the basics and moving further on to advanced level.

# Project 1 :
 Titanic Survival Exploration
 
Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age.<br>Started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. 


# Project 2 :
 Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools.<br> Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

# Project 3 :
 Building a Student Intervention System

Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school.<br> Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. <br>Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.

# Project 4 :
Creating Customer Segments

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. <br>Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results.<br> Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

# Project 5 :
 Train a Smartcab How to Drive

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. <br>This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

#Project 6 :
Digit Recognizer

Kaggle Competitions -https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer<br>
Task: Detect the written digits using data of various digits with labels from 0 - 10.<br>
Applied Random Forest with variable number of estimators and analyed it's relation with the accuracy. Similaryly did another implementation using PCA and then K-N-N since it seemed like a good fit.

#Project 7 :
Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!

Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo<br>
Task: to given features of creatures , classify them as Ghouls , Goblins & Ghosts.<br>
Used PCA + LR + Hyperparameter Optimization + SVM each on its independent try.

#Project 8 :
Facial Keypoint Detection

Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection<br>
Task: to detect the facial keypoints such as nose_tip , eye_center etc given images with around 15 labelled keypoints as data.<br>
Applied CNN using librarires Lasagne & Theano and achieved 56th position on the leaderboard.

#Project 9:
House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
Task: With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

#Project 10:
Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries

Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries
Task: predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website.
