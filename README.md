# Machine_learning_Projects
These are my Machine learning projects starting from the basics and moving further on to advanced level.

# Project 1 :
 Titanic Survival Exploration
 
Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age.Started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. 


# Project 2 :
 Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

# Project 3 :
 Building a Student Intervention System

Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.

# Project 4 :
 Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

# Project 5 :
 Train a Smartcab How to Drive

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.
