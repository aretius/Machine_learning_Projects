Digit Recgonizer

Kaggle Competitions -https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer<br>
Task: Detect the written digits using data of various digits with labels from 0 - 10.<br>

So this is my implementation of the Digit Recgonizer Kaggle Competition. I have first used Random Forest to get an accuracy of 96% but then
shifted to PCA with KNN to improve my accuracy to 97%.
I have uploaded the ipynb file which contains both of my implementations.
