Indeed is the world’s #1 job site, serving 200 million unique visitors each month in more than 60 countries and 28 languages. What started as a job search engine has become a destination for job seekers and employers, a place where people share resumes, learn about companies and apply for jobs on any device. With the job seeker experience at the core of all decision-making, Indeed’s culture is built around the mission, “I help people get jobs.” 

Join our CodeSprint for the chance to solve a real-world machine learning problem based on Indeed’s data. Indeed is recruiting machine learning specialists of all levels to join our data science teams in the United States and Asia. We are looking to grow our teams with people who share our energy and enthusiasm for creating the best experience for job seekers.
